A Little Context

I've been out of undergrad for over a year now, but there's one thing I really miss: research. There's something captivating about it, formulating questions that are shaped by your experiences and curiosities into something deeper, making connections across disparate sources, and following threads that don't have tidy conclusions. During college, I participated in such research activities, most notably with Professor Johanna Brewer, to investigate how Twitch streamers cultivate and sustain feelings of community among their audiences.
Surprisingly, academia still constitutes a substantial portion of my professional life, just in different forms. I collaborate with universities through CIB Mango Tree, and I organize the DC chapter of ACM, the largest professional society for scholarly computing. Yet I still miss the scholarly work, the building of something new from scratch. It was when I was reading Andy Matuschak's "Reflections on 2020 as an independent researcher" that I started to think about what does it means to become an independent researcher and how I can do it?

What is independent research?
First, it's important to define what independent research actually means. The term has multiple interpretations, so I've constructed my understanding from its two constituent components. Independent signifies my lack of formal affiliation with traditional scholarly infrastructures, academia, research institutions, or think tanks. Research is the pursuit of knowledge in a specific field, in my case, human-computer interaction. Together, this term represents a reclaim on the aspects of scholarly work I found most compelling: the open-ended questions, the iterative processes, and the intellectual autonomy of exploring what I want. Research is a public good that should be contributed to by anyone with genuine curiosity and methodological rigor.

This definition offers freedom, but that freedom comes with ambiguity. Without institutional structures, I have had to identify my own patterns and frameworks that universities and research labs would ordinarily provide. Paradoxically, this flexibility has allowed me to challenge the boundaries of what it means to conduct research. Rather than exclusively sharing my work when it's polished and presentable, I publicly focus on the least rosy parts of my work - what is confusing, frustrating, and what's not working. I believe in the "Learn in Public" philosophy: documenting and disseminating what you discover in real time.
Okay, what is your research then?

My work specifically focuses on open-source communities, civic technology, and the policy frameworks that support them. Because I maintain multiple concurrent projects (see here), my research questions (see here) serve a dual function: they provide scaffolding that frames each project while deepening my understanding of the thematic connections and patterns across my portfolio of work. It will also be public facing: writings like this, project documentation, and prototypes, all with the long-term aspiration of formal papers when applicable.

While my research initially may seem like a well-researched Substack, it is actually the best of best of both worlds! My work lives in that middle ground, public-facing like Substack, but grounded in creating new insights through interviews, experiments, and triangulated findings across multiple sources.

A Last Note
So, here's to the formal start of this independent research journey! And who knows, I may return to school and formally become an academic researcher. But for now, most fittingly, what initially drew me to research in the first place, curiosity, is precisely what I can now explore more expansively and authentically.

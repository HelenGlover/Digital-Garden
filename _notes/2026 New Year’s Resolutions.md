New Year's Resolutions have a way of slipping through the cracks once February arrives, but last year I discovered something that has helped me change that pattern: the simple act of documentation. By committing my intentions to paper and periodically revisiting them, I didn't just accomplish what I set out to do (which felt incredible); the practice of reflection also gave me a clearer understanding of my interests and opened doors to opportunities I hadn't anticipated.

This year, I’m writing down my goals more publicly (thanks, [Tracey Chou](https://triketora.com) for the inspiration.

Naturally, I've held back some goals as not everything belongs on the internet.

## **Professional Development**

### **Continuing Engagements**  

**Civic Tech DC:** Last year, I was promoted to Director of Civic Tech DC, a nonprofit of technologists developing open-source projects. Some goals include: 
  
- <b>Expand our community </b>as the tech meetup circuit in DC tends to skew heavily professional. I want to cultivate deeper roots in the communities we're actually building for. That means bringing in nontechnical folks who can challenge assumptions about what technology can accomplish, ambitious young people, and DC natives who know this city at its structural level. 
- <b>Develop a Civic Tech playbook</b> based on lessons learned from running the organization and best practices for sustaining civic tech initiatives. What actually sustains civic tech initiatives when the initial enthusiasm fades? How to keep momentum and motivation alive?
- <b>Make civic tech less insular</b>. I am working on collaborating with local organizations to host special events that make civic tech exciting. With the U.S.'s 250th anniversary, it's a natural moment to focus on what civic participation really means in showing up and taking responsibility for the communities we live in.

**CIB Mango Tree:** Last September, we just celebrated our one year of CIB Mango Tree, an open-source initiative building tools to detect coordinated inauthentic behavior. As Engagement Lead, I want to: 

- <b>Continue supporting growth</b> in the team’s project management, outreach, and community development, which includes expanding partnerships with universities.
- <b>Strengthen our credibility through more rigorous, public-facing writing</b>. We're building tools that matter for information integrity, and that work needs to be shared beyond our immediate network. We are actually doing at over on Medium.

**Internet Law and Foundry:** As a member of the Editorial and Marketing Committee of the Foundry, an organization of early-career professionals in law, technology, and policy, this year I will move into a Senior Fellow role and will work to:

- <b>Build a more substantive community with increased visibility</b> by strengthening connections across the network, creating additional opportunities for members to share their work, and hosting engaging events. While the Foundry primarily serves professionals already in the field, a key goal is to involve more individuals who are interested in the field. Everyone has to start somewhere, and having a network helps.

### **Engagements in the Making**  

**Supporting the DC Ecosystem:** Host a "super meetup" that brings together various local meetup groups to share what's working, what isn't, and how to better support volunteer-led initiatives that can effectively sustain themselves long-term.

**Independent Research**
- This year, I'm reviving the independent research I started last year, focusing on the structural and social dimensions of technology. Writing remains my primary tool for thinking through complex ideas, as it helps identify patterns across different projects that might otherwise stay siloed. (I love tools, like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), designed specifically to help mind organization).

- I'm thrilled by the number of universities and think tanks in the DMV region, and by the community events and opportunities to engage. I want to explore more structured ways to engage with these groups in building connections that deepen my understanding and create opportunities for longer-term collaboration.

**Academia-Industry Collaboration:** Based on my experience working in both academia and industry, I have seen a clear gap between the two. D.C. is uniquely positioned to bridge this divide; the region is full of people who move between both sectors (professors of practice, industry researchers), yet there are surprisingly few opportunities for meaningful exchange. I am in conversation with the DC chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery on:

- Hosting events that pair researchers presenting problems or findings with industry professionals who can explore practical applications and implementation challenges.
- Engaging local nonprofits, coalitions, and student groups to make these discussions actionable rather than theoretical. This would include experimenting with formats like fireside chats and smaller-group conversations.

## **Personal Development**

- **Language Learning:** Since Chinese is my native language, improving my fluency has always been a personal goal. In the past, without a clear plan or consistent practice, progress has been limited. This year, I want to approach it more deliberately.  

- **Running:** Train for and complete a 10 miler.  

- **Reading:** I read a lot of books each year, mostly focused on personal development. This year, I plan to read more intentionally, using Obsidian and Zotero to organize insights. One of my strengths is connecting ideas across fields, and I want to strengthen this skill through thoughtful, structured reading.

#### **A Note on Goals**

Even if you don’t achieve them exactly as planned, it doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Goals naturally evolve as you learn and encounter new opportunities. For example, a goal to run a 5-minute mile might shift to focusing on endurance and completing six miles, or even spending that time on another hobby. What truly matters is making progress and using resolutions as a tool for personal growth and self-improvement.

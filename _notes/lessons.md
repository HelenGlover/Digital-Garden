<h2>Words from the Wise and Lessons</h2>

The job you seek might not exist today, but might in the future. Remain adaptable and visionary for future opportunities that could arise as the world changes. *(Mentor)*


To create effective new policy, stay curious - especially with those whose ideas you may disagree with. It is through such openness that fresh perspectives and understanding can emerge. *(Aspen Institute: Action and Impact: Empowering Policy Changemakers)*

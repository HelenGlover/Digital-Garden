I've spent the last [X years] working in DC's tech ecosystem, primarily at the intersection of open source and civic tech. Here's where I focus my attention—and why.

## Supporting Emerging Organizers

The most impactful work often happens before something becomes "the flashiest new thing." I'm drawn to the early stages: the first meetup, the uncertain experiment, the organizer who's figuring it out as they go.

I focus on:
- **Experimentation and ideation** - Helping communities test what works without the pressure of immediate scale
- **Building sustainable momentum** - Supporting the transition from "interesting idea" to "repeatable practice"
- **Infrastructure over spotlight** - The unsexy work of documentation, connection-making, and capacity building

## Why This Matters

Established communities get plenty of attention and resources. Emerging ones need support during their most vulnerable phase—when an organizer is juggling a full-time job, uncertain if anyone will show up, and wondering if they're doing it "right."

This is where real innovation happens. This is where I show up.

## Working Together

I bring this philosophy to the organizations and communities I work with—whether that's through direct participation, advising, or consulting on community strategy. If you're building something new in the DC tech space and want to talk through your approach, [reach out](contact-link).

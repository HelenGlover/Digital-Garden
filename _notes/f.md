description: Giving independent research credibility through structure
---

Embarking on an independent research journey means stepping outside the traditional structures of academia. I recognize that many people view research with external validation: being invited to give a talk or publishing in a scholarly journal signals credibility within a field. 

Academia also has a familiar quantifiable rhythm; you know how long it should take to complete a PhD, how many papers you should produce, and which metrics define progress toward tenure. From this perspective, independent research can seem like a low-stakes detour around years of formal training.

If the goal of research is the intentional pursuit of knowledge to support others, then independent research is meaningful because it produces real-world impact. While independent work may not always result in traditional scholarly papers or books (although that is a fun goal 20 years from now), it is rigorous in its own right, producing impact-based, alternative forms of outputs. These outputs might not undergo peer review, but they are evaluated through stakeholder feedback and real-world testing.

Embracing the title of “independent researcher” means doing the field justie by holding oneself to high standards and clearly articulating the scope of one’s work. I share some of my articulation below:

## Research Statement 

Overall, my work explores how technology shapes collaboration, knowledge, and community infrastructure but my research statement is:

> I am an interdisciplinary designer, defined by my versatility at the intersection of emerging, deep technology, and strategic design. I explore two key dimensions of technology: the structure, focused on the security and stability of emerging technologies, and the social, centered on how digital growth shapes societal structures. I believe in intersectionality, recognizing that no topic exists in isolation and that the most effective solutions come from blending insights across disciplines.
> Structurally, I explore the infrastructure and processes that underpin emerging technologies. 
> What tools and mindsets allow these technologies to move from ideation to implementation and adaptation? 
> What are their impacts on automation, productivity, and the expansion of human intelligence? I also focus on how we can scale innovation responsibly, balancing speed with governance standards and cybersecurity resilience.
> How do emerging technologies support or challenge community formation and individual expression? How is new tech an alternative to mainstream platforms?
> Socially, I examine the benefits and challenges within the interconnected networks between technology and human relationships. 
> How are online communities sustained, with a focus on open-source and digital grassroots activism? This includes understanding the evolving role of platforms in shaping civic discourse and the ongoing debate between freedom of speech and digital rights.
> What role do community communication platforms have in the spread of misinformation? How can we balance censorship and moderation effectively?

## Research Methodology

My research methodology is best described as applied ethnography with qualitative methods. I study communities and their practices through interviews, observations, and iterative prototyping, documenting insights publicly. It is suited to the fast-moving communities I study. 

Ethnography is the same type of research I practiced in college, so I have a solid foundation. While ethnography is sometimes criticized for its subjectivity, this perspective allows for a nuanced, contextual understanding that purely quantitative approaches cannot capture. As Rimjhim Surana highlights in her article:

<!-- ## Creating Structure in Independent Research

I value structure, and the ambiguity of independent research can be challenging. To address this, I intentionally create frameworks to guide my work. I learn in public as a way to share my research. Constantly learning. DC has many amazing things to offer, but if someone were to ask what my favorite thing about the city is, it would be the access to free knowledge. Many university events are open to the public, and things I learn from those events and talking to people directly feed directly into my research. -->

## In Practice
With independent research, the final product often isn’t clear at the start; it emerges through the process of learning. The blog reflects this ongoing exploration, but I also have a more concrete example: the Civic Tech DC Playbook. Since 2013, Civic Tech DC has accumulated knowledge about building civic technology, organizing volunteers, and partnering with nonprofits to solve community challenges. This playbook demonstrates independent research in action: it will apply ethnographic observation to organizational processes and produce a resource for the community.

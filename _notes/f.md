Embarking on an independent research journey means stepping outside the traditional structures of academia. I recognize that many people view research with external validation: being invited to give a talk or publishing in a scholarly journal signals credibility within a field. 

Academia also has a familiar quantifiable rhythm; you know how long it should take to complete a PhD, how many papers you should produce, and which metrics define progress toward tenure. From this perspective, independent research can seem like a low-stakes detour around years of formal training.

If the goal of research is the intentional pursuit of knowledge to support others, independent research is meaningful because it produces real-world impact. While independent work may not always result in traditional scholarly papers or books (although that is a possible long-term goal), it is rigorous in its own right: outputs are evaluated through stakeholder feedback, iterative testing, and practical application. 

Embracing the title of “independent researcher” means holding oneself to high standards and clearly articulating the scope, methodology, and rigor of one’s work. I share some of that articulation below:

## Research Statement 

My research statement can be viewed here, but overall, my work explores how technology shapes collaboration, knowledge, and community infrastructure. What drives me most is ensuring that technology works for people.

## Research Methodology

My research methodology is best described as applied digital ethnography with qualitative methods. I study communities and their practices through interviews, observation, participation, and iterative prototyping, documenting and sharing insights publicly. It is suited to the fast-moving, physical, and digitally mediated digital communities I study. 

Ethnography is the same type of research I practiced in college, so I have a solid foundation. While ethnography is sometimes criticized for its subjectivity, this perspective allows for a nuanced, contextual understanding that purely quantitative approaches cannot capture. As Rimjhim Surana highlights in her article:

## Creating Structure in Independent Research

I value structure, and the ambiguity of independent research can be challenging. To address this, I intentionally create frameworks to guide my work. I learn in public as a way to share my research. Constantly learning. DC has many amazing things to offer, but if someone were to ask what my favorite thing about the city is, it would be the access to free knowledge. Many university events are open to the public, and things I learn from those events and talking to people directly feed directly into my research.

## In Practice
Independent research needs some sort of output, which I am doing with this blog, but here is a more concrete project: Civic Tech DC Playbook. Since 2013, Civic Tech DC has accumulated knowledge about building civic technology, organizing volunteers, and partnering with nonprofits to solve community challenges. This playbook demonstrates independent research in action: it will apply ethnographic observation to organizational processes and produce a resource for the community.

title: Questions Worth Getting Lost In

    - Indepedent Research

Let’s be honest. Independent research means no one’s checking if you’ve spent multiple hours reading someone’s tech blog from 2013—which you can say is helping you tie the past to the present, but is really just passive exploration. So I’ve given myself some research questions, not to constrain curiosity, but to channel it. They keep me focused while still leaving room to explore, adapt, and occasionally get delightfully sidetracked—intentionally this time.

These questions reflect how I think about technology.

I explore two key dimensions of technology:
- **Structural**: focused on the security and stability of emerging technologies  
- **Social**: centered on how digital growth shapes societal structures  

I believe in intersectionality, recognizing that no topic exists in isolation and that the most effective solutions come from blending insights across disciplines.

Each question is tied to the actual work I do, whether that’s the communities I’m part of or the projects I’m building. And of course, they will evolve as I discover new, more interesting avenues—or limitations.

## Structural

- **How do emerging technologies move from ideation to implementation and adaptation?**
  - How can we bridge the gap between academia and industry?
  - What models accelerate research-to-practice translation by combining the deep rigor of academia with the innovative attitude of industry?
  - How can we democratize knowledge production through civic science?
  - *Action: Exploring in relation to my consulting work with universities and my organizing work with the Association for Computing Machinery.*

- **Is DC’s VC ecosystem expanding?**
  - What factors are driving changes in the region’s investment landscape?
  - How do regional characteristics (policy proximity, talent pipelines) shape its trajectory?
  - *Action: Exploring in relation to my consulting work with industry and my professional goal to lean more into VC.*

- **What organizational structures and behaviors enable groups to work effectively?**
  - How do formal structures (hierarchy, decision-making processes) and informal dynamics (incentives, communication patterns) interact to support collaborative effectiveness?
  - *Action: Exploring in relation to ecosystem-building through groups I help run.*

## Social

- **How do technology and human relationships shape each other within interconnected networks?**
  - What sustains voluntaristic open technology communities?
  - What motivates participation in online projects?
  - How do digital coordination practices inform or differ from traditional community organizing?
  - *Action: Exploring in relation to CIB Mango Tree.*

- **What does it really mean to build community?**
  - Beyond the buzzword, what ecosystem-building practices create genuine community bonds?
  - What role does technology play in facilitating community formation?
  - *Action: Exploring in relation to Civic Tech DC.*

- **Can meetups gain credibility?**
  - Merriam-Webster defines meetups as “an informal meeting or get-together.”
  - What would it take for a region’s economic establishment, businesses, investors, and institutions to recognize meetups as vital contributors to ecosystem-building rather than merely casual networking?
  - *Action: Exploring in relation to ecosystem-building through groups I help run.*

## So What? Research in Practice

Unlike traditional research projects with neat methodologies and predetermined outputs (aka the classic academic paper), independent research means wandering around a bit before you know exactly what you’re building. Many of these questions will eventually have outcomes:
- Structural outcomes, like developing new community practices at Mango Tree CIB by exploring *“What sustains voluntaristic open technology communities?”*
- Product-focused outcomes, like building a community playbook at Civic Tech DC by investigating *“What does it really mean to build community?”*

But for now, the work is delightfully messy and exploratory:

- **Ethnographic observation**
  - When I attend events, I carry a notebook to record observations and map patterns.
  - Later, I synthesize these observations into my research notebooks.

- **Conversational interviews**
  - Or, in fancy research terms, “semi-structured informal interviews.”
  - In practice, they’re good conversations—with consent forms and question scripts—where I learn from people’s experiences and explore potential collaborations.

These questions aren’t meant to be answered definitively. They’re meant to guide curiosity and ultimately produce something useful—whether that’s new practices, better tools, or a clearer understanding of how technology and community intersect.

The best research happens when you’re genuinely curious and actively engaged. These questions keep me both.

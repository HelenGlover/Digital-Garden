<h2>Holistic sustainability</h2>

<p>I believe in a sustainability that extends beyond being merely "life-affirming" or "green." Instead, it represents a holistic understanding that encompasses environmental, social, and economic dimensions. 
<br><br>
To quote the <a href="https://afors.org/">Alliance for Sustainability's Greenprint,</a> an org which I am a board member of, "we seek to embed our co-created, comprehensive and integrative understanding of sustainability as a core operating principle in our way of thinking and culture, including every institution and policy."

<h2>In politics</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, sustainability topics, more notably climate change, are divisive and political. 
<!-- I do not believe in the categorization of those who care about the environment versus those who do not. Instead, w -->
When discussing the environment, I believe in fostering conversations that find common ground and seek to understand the unique livelihoods of individuals with diverse environmental beliefs.
<br><br>
I am inspired by Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, a renowned scientist who knows how to speak to politically diverse audiences about climate change.

<h2>In faith</h2>
<p>I am interested in taoism, a Chinese faith and philosophy that sees sustainability as a holistic concept encompassing the entire ecosystem, emphasizing that humans should live in ecological balance. 

<br><br> 
Sustainability is deeply interlinked with other religions and faiths, and it is fascinating to hear what people think. For example, Pope Francis's encyclical on caring for planet Earth, <a href="https://laudatosimovement.org/">Laudato Siâ€™</a> has now become a movement within Christianity.</p>

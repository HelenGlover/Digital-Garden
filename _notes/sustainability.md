<h3>Holistic Sustainability</h3>
  I believe in a definition of sustainability beyond being merely “green.” Instead, it represents a holistic understanding encompassing environmental, social, and economic dimensions.
  <br><br>
  To quote the <a href="https://afors.org/short-description-and-executive-summary-of-the-alliance/">Alliance for Sustainability</a>, a nonprofit of which I am a board member:

  >"We seek to embed our co-created, comprehensive and integrative understanding of sustainability as a core operating principle in our way of thinking and culture, including every institution and policy."

  This perspective emphasizes sustainability as a multi-faceted approach that requires the active participation of individuals and communities for a better future for all.

<h3>Across the Aisle</h3>

  In a world of intense political rhetoric, climate change remains a contentious issue.

  I believe in fostering conversations that bridge differences and embrace the unique perspectives of individuals with diverse environmental beliefs. Since climate challenges often stem from discussions around energy production, solutions to climate change must also be framed economically. <b> There is common ground for climate; the best ideas emerge from bipartisan efforts.</b>

  I am inspired by Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, a renowned scientist who knows how to speak to politically diverse audiences about climate change. As she said in her book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Saving-Us/Katharine-Hayhoe/9781982143848">Saving Us</a>:
  >"Beginning a conversation with something that unites us instead of something that divides us means we are starting at a place of mutual respect, agreement and understanding - which is pretty much the opposite of where most conversations about contentious issues like climate change begin these days."

  
  Highly recommend checking out her story at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/how-to-talk-about-climate-change-across-the-political-divide">The New Yorker: How to Talk About Climate Change Across the Political Divide</a>.

<h3>Traditional Knowledge </h3>
 
  Sustainability is deeply interwoven with various religions and faiths, reflecting shared values through their distinct yet similar approaches to environmental stewardship. Here are a few inspiring examples:

  <a href="https://interfaithsustain.com/daoist-faith-statement-on-the-environment/">Taoism</a> is an incredible Chinese philosophy that sees sustainability as a holistic concept encompassing the entire ecosystem, emphasizing that humans should live in ecological balance. </li>

  Pope Francis's encyclical on caring for planet Earth, <a href="https://laudatosimovement.org/">Laudato Si’</a>, has become a movement within Christianity.
  
 Many Indigenous spiritual traditions emphasize a deep connection to the land, viewing nature as sacred. From the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tek/description.htm">National Park Service</a>, 
 
>"Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is the on-going accumulation of knowledge, practice and belief about relationships between living beings in a specific ecosystem that is acquired by indigenous people over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment, handed down through generations, and used for life-sustaining ways."

 
 As we navigate the evolving challenges of our modern world, drawing knowledge from these diverse spiritual teachings can honor their culture and strengthen collective sustainable action.

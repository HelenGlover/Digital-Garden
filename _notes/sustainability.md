<h3>Holistic Sustainability</h3>
  I believe in a definition of sustainability that goes beyond being merely "green." Instead, it represents a holistic understanding that encompasses environmental, social, and economic dimensions.
  <br><br>
  To quote the <a href="https://afors.org/">Alliance for Sustainability's Greenprint,</a> an organization of which I am a board member:

  >"We seek to embed our co-created, comprehensive and integrative understanding of sustainability as a core operating principle in our way of thinking and culture, including every institution and policy."

  This perspective emphasizes sustainability as a multi-faceted approach that requires the active participation of individuals, communities, and institutions for a better future for all.

<h3>In the News </h3>

  Unfortunately, sustainability topics, more notably climate change, are divisive and political. 
<!-- I do not believe in the categorization of those who care about the environment versus those who do not. Instead, w -->
  When discussing the environment, I believe in fostering conversations that find common ground and seek to understand the unique livelihoods of individuals with diverse environmental beliefs.
  <br> I am inspired by Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, a renowned scientist who knows how to speak to politically diverse audiences about climate change. As she said in her book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Saving-Us/Katharine-Hayhoe/9781982143848">Saving Us</a>:
  >"Beginning a conversation with something that unites us instead of something that divides us means we are starting at a place of mutual respect, agreement and understanding - which is pretty much the opposite of where most conversations about contentious issues like climate change begin these days"
  
  Highly recommend checking out her story at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/how-to-talk-about-climate-change-across-the-political-divide">The New Yorker: How to Talk About Climate Change Across the Political Divide</a>.

<h3>In Philosophy </h3>
<p>Taoism is an incredible Chinese philosophy that sees sustainability as a holistic concept encompassing the entire ecosystem, emphasizing that humans should live in ecological balance. 

<br>
Sustainability is deeply interlinked with various religions and faiths, highlighting the shared values found in their diverse yet similar approaches to environmental stewardship.

<ul>
    <li>Pope Francis's encyclical on caring for planet Earth, <a href="https://laudatosimovement.org/">Laudato Siâ€™</a>, has become a movement within Christianity.</li>
    <li>Many Indigenous spiritual traditions emphasize a deep connection to the land, viewing nature as sacred. This relationship is represented through the traditional ecological knowledge of the Anishinaabe people in the Great Lakes region.</li>
</ul> 
<br>
 As we navigate the challenges of our modern world, drawing from these diverse spiritual teachings can inspire collective action towards a sustainable future.

title: 2026 New Year’s Resolutions 
labels: 
    - goals
---

Like many others, I create resolutions on the first day of the new year. While goals often take a backseat by the end of January, last year I found that writing them down in a notebook and revisiting them, especially by sharing progress, helped me not only accomplish them but also discover new opportunities.  

This year, I’m writing down my goals more publicly (thanks, [Tracey Chou](https://triketora.com) for the inspiration) for accountability and to share what I’m focusing on.

Of course, I haven’t included every goal; some are more personal :)

## **Professional Development**

#### **Continuing Engagements**  

- **Civic Tech DC:** Last year, I was promoted to Director of Civic Tech DC, a nonprofit of technologists developing open-source projects:  
- Continue building momentum with the audiences I want to see more of in the tech community: women, those from non-technical backgrounds, young people, and D.C. natives.  
- Develop a Civic Tech playbook based on lessons learned from running the organization and best practices for sustaining civic tech initiatives.  
- Collaborate with local organizations to host special events that make civic tech more accessible to a wider audience. In celebration of the U.S.'s 250th anniversary, these events will emphasize civic engagement and participation.

- **CIB Mango Tree:** As Engagement Lead of CIB Mango Tree, an open-source initiative building tools to detect coordinated inauthentic behavior:  
  - Continue supporting growth in the team’s project management, outreach, and community development, including expanding partnerships with universities.  
  - Strengthen CIB Mango Tree’s research portfolio through increased writing.  
  - Develop my personal brand as a young project leader by producing original research and thought leadership, demonstrating how individual contributions can drive impact while elevating the organization’s visibility.

- **Internet Law and Foundry:** As a member of the Editorial and Marketing Committee of the Foundry, an organization of early-career professionals in law, technology, and policy:  
  - Build a more substantive community with increased visibility by strengthening connections across the network, creating additional opportunities for members to share their work, and hosting engaging events. While the Foundry primarily serves professionals already in the field, a key goal is to involve more individuals who are interested.   

#### **Engagements in the Making**  

- **Supporting the DC Ecosystem:** Host a “super meetup” bringing together various local meetup groups to share lessons and support volunteer-led initiatives.  
<br>
- **Independent Research:**  
  - Fully revive and actively contribute to my independent research blog, with a focus on the structural and social dimensions of technology, open-source communities, and civic tech.  
  - Use writing as a tool for introspection and deeper thinking, helping clarify ideas and identify patterns across projects.  
  - Expand engagement with universities and research labs in DC to build connections, increase understanding, and create collaboration opportunities.  
<br>
- **Academia-Industry Collaboration:** Based on my experience working with both universities and industry, and seeing the gap between them, I plan to support a group in coordination with ACM DC dedicated to fostering connections:  
  - Pair researchers presenting problems or findings with industry professionals to explore practical applications.  
  - Engage local nonprofits, coalitions, and student groups to make discussions actionable, using experimental formats such as fireside chats and group conversations.

## **Personal Development**

- **Language Learning:** Since Chinese is my native language, improving my fluency has always been a personal goal. In the past, without a clear plan or consistent practice, progress has been limited. This year, I want to approach it more deliberately.  

- **Running:** Train for and complete a 10k.  

- **Reading:** I read a lot of books each year, mostly focused on personal development. This year, I plan to read more intentionally, using Obsidian and Zotero to organize insights. One of my strengths is connecting ideas across fields, and I want to strengthen this skill through thoughtful, structured reading.

#### **A Note on Goals**

Even if you don’t achieve them exactly as planned, it doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Goals naturally evolve as you learn and encounter new opportunities. For example, a goal to run a 5-minute mile might shift to focusing on endurance and completing six miles, or even spending that time on another hobby. What truly matters is making progress and using resolutions as a tool for personal growth and self-improvement.

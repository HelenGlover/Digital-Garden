Embarking on an independent research journey means stepping outside the traditional structures of academia. 
I recognize that many people view research with external validation: being invited to give a talk or publishing in a 
scholarly journal signals credibility within a field. Academia also has a familiar quantifiable rhythm; you know how long it 
should take to complete a PhD, how many papers you should produce, and which metrics define progress toward tenure. From this 
perspective, independent research can seem like a low-stakes detour around years of formal training.
If the goal of research is the intentional pursuit of knowledge to support others, independent research is meaningful because it 
produces real-world impact. While independent work may not always result in traditional scholarly papers or books 
(although that is a possible long-term goal), it is rigorous in its own right: outputs are evaluated through stakeholder feedback, 
iterative testing, and practical application. Embracing the title of “independent researcher” means holding oneself to high standards 
and clearly articulating the scope, methodology, and rigor of one’s work. I share some of that articulation below:

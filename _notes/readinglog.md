<p> When I was younger, I dreamed of being a librarian so I could read all day. <br><br>

While my goals have changed, here are some books I’ve been enjoying. Will update with each month. <br><br>

            The 7-Minute Productivity Solution
        </a>
    </b> by John Brandon <br><br>

    <p style="padding: 2em 2em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px; color: #000; width: 90%; line-height: 2.5;">
        Productivity is the pursuit of external goals. It’s essential to shift our perspective on productivity from solely self-improvement to a focus on serving others and making a meaningful difference. <br><br> There is a distinction between a morning routine, which allows you to reflect on "moments of hope," versus planning your day. While both are important, they serve different purposes in enhancing productivity.

            The Art of Visual Notetaking
        </a>
    </b> by Emily Mills <br><br>

    <p style="padding: 2em 2em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px; color: #000; width: 90%; line-height: 2.5;">
        A new form of recollection, visual notetaking combines words and images to enhance understanding and retention. It encourages active listening and engagement, making it easier to process and recall information. <br><br> Simple sketching techniques, such as icons, arrows, and shapes, can effectively convey complex ideas. You don’t need to be an artist; basic drawings can communicate concepts clearly.

<p> When I was younger, my dream job was to be a librarian and read all day. <br><br>

In college, I stop reading as I was already doing that with reading assignments, but now as a recent graduate, here are the books
I have been reading. I highly recommend all of these books, or else I probably won't have finished it. Starred books are extremely interesting.
I do not include links to books simply as I do not favor any retail store - but do consider libraries and mom and pop bookshops. </p>

<p> When I was younger, I dreamed of being a librarian so I could read all day. <br><br>

While my goals have changed, here are some books I’ve been enjoying. Will update with each month. <br><br>

There are no links as I do not promote any particular retailer, but I encourage supporting libraries and bookstores.

    <ul>
    <li>Productivity is the pursuit of external goals. It’s essential to shift our perspective on productivity from solely self-improvement to a focus on serving others and making a meaningful difference.
    <li> There is a distinction between a morning routine, which allows you to reflect on "moments of hope", versus planning your day. While both are important, they serve different purposes in enhancing productivity.
    </ul>

<b>The Art of Visual Notetaking</b> by Emily Mills

<p style="padding: 2em 2em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px; color: #000; width: 90%; line-height: 2.5;">
    <ul>
    <li>A new form of recollection, visual notetaking combines words and images to enhance understanding and retention. It encourages active listening and engagement, making it easier to process and recall information.
    <li> Simple sketching techniques, such as icons, arrows, and shapes, can effectively convey complex ideas. You don’t need to be an artist; basic drawings can communicate concepts clearly.
    </ul>

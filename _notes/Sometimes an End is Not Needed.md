title: Sometimes an End is Not Needed
description: Community initiatives should not be evaluated by permanence but by the capacity they create. In draft, coming soon!

If there is one thing most people will learn immediately when they meet me, it's that I ask what the end is. As humans, we like to have an end. It allows us to close the chapter, check off a list, and write down our accomplishments. Especially in product design, it is easy to see that the end of a project is the successful creation and deployment of said product.

In product design, the arc is linear:

> idea → build → ship → maintain → sunset

But in community building, especially in volunteer capacities, what does that look like? Is there an end? The shape of the work is fundamentally different, in which it is cyclical:

> gather → experiment → support → adapt → regenerate (or conclude)

And that cycle doesn't come with a clear finish line, the way a product does.

And honestly? That's frustrating because when you tend to seek out the finish line, working in a space where one doesn't exist, at least not in any visible way, feels like running without a destination. It's hard to know if you're making progress when there's no clear metric for what progress even looks like. But frustration has a way of forcing you to look closer at the work itself. And the more I sat with that discomfort, the more I started seeing it show up in real, specific ways.

I've seen this play out in my own work. With Mango Tree, there is the goal to build software tools to detect coordinated inauthentic behavior. But the overall goal is to "build for a healthier, more robust internet." As someone more rigid in always working towards an end, what does that actually mean, and how do you know when you've gotten there? The same question applies to my work with Civic Tech DC. We exist as a community for volunteer technologists to contribute their skills, but what does that mean in practice? How long does it last?

Mango Tree is an interesting case because we actually have a hybrid model. We develop disinformation detection tools — that's the product side — but we also contribute to broader community output, with the long-term aspiration of a healthier information environment. To help navigate that, we have systems in place like sprints and a biweekly cadence. As much as people want to do something, they can lack motivation — and that's very human. But having that regular structure, like project nights, gives people the push to actually get stuff done and keeps capacity building. And that capacity doesn't just benefit the people involved — it feeds back into the work itself. Building the community isn't separate from building the tool. It supports the tool in its reach, its legitimacy, and its resilience. The two reinforce each other.

And yet, even with those systems in place, the honest answer is that there is an end — but it's rarely visible from the beginning, and it's almost never a single moment. It's not about object completion but creating conditions of openness for the community to lean into.

So, in my time with both projects, I learned a better reframing: the goal of a community is not permanence; it's capacity. And that's actually a good thing — capacity benefits people's careers in ways that go beyond simplifying their day-to-day. It can look like:

- People gaining **skills they didn't have before**
- Relationships forming that **outlive the community**
- Norms and practices that **spread elsewhere**
- Work that **would not have happened otherwise**

A useful mental model for all of this is thinking about communities as infrastructure, as a form of scaffolding. And I have also learned that there is no such thing as a community dying. They end because they completed their role in a particular moment in time. If the capacity they built outlives them, then they did exactly what they were supposed to do.

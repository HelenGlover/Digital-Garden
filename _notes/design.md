<h2>Systemic design</h2>

<p>During my time with Oxfam, I learned about systematic design, a approach to being more systematic in the way we work with others to create change.

<br><br>
  The <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/systemic-design-framework/">Design Council</a> describes it as:

  >"the acknowledgement of complexity and interconnectedness throughout the design thinking and doing process. It is both a mindset and a methodology - considering the structures and beliefs that underpin a challenge." 


<br>
This is what I prioritize in community conversations. I believe that systemic design fosters a more inclusive and holistic approach to problem-solving, encouraging collaboration among diverse stakeholders. By acknowledging the complexities and interconnectedness of social, environmental, and economic systems, we can create solutions that are not only innovative but also equitable and sustainable.

<h2>Design Justice</h2>

  When we create new technologies, systems, structures, or anything else, we need to prioritize design justice by including the people who will be most impacted by our work in the conversation. If we do not consider these individuals, we risk exacerbating existing, structural inequalities.

<h2>The Power of Sprints</h2>

With ambitious, long-term goals, it can get hard to focus on the short-term, sometimes monotonous, shorter tasks that are essential to achieving that long-term vision. To focus my mind and track my goals, I use sprints.

Sprints are short, periods of time to focus on a few predetermined things. It is considered the heartbeat of scrum, a project management framework for enhancing team collaboration and delivering on goals. I first learned about sprints in one of my research projects and have been loving it ever since.

While scrum is predominantly used in software development, it can be used in other areas â€“ for me, my personal life. Scrum is best done with teamwork (check out my plastic project to see sprints applied to actual teamwork), but to adjust it to my personal goals, t looks something like this:

The nonprofit Girl Security* generously gave me funding to take the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. I am deeply interested in cybersecurity in relation to user privacy and social engineering, and this certificate will allow me to gain the foundations needed to eventually consider taking Security+.

By Google standards, the certificate is intended to take six months, but I hope to finish it by the end of the year.

At the end of each week, I do a retrospective, another scrum methodology. The goal of a sprint is to evaluate what went well during the sprint, what problems I encountered, and how those problems were solved. Even if I did not accomplish everything, I put on my agenda that week, my goal is to feel comfortable with my definition of done. Tasks that were not completed get reassessed and reprioritize for their alignment against everything else in the product backlog.

And of course, since I have other things, I am working on - supporting a project for a civic tech nonprofit in D.C., doing research on youth digital rights with the goal of getting it published one day (and some other things), they also get added to my sprint.

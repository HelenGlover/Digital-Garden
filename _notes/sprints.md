title: The Power of Sprints

With ambitious, long-term goals, it can be hard to focus on the shorter, sometimes monotonous tasks essential to achieving that long-term vision. To stay focused on the vision, I use sprints.

<b>Sprints</b> are fixed lengths of time to complete an allocated, predetermined amount of work. They are considered the heartbeat of <b>scrum</b>, a project management framework for enhancing team collaboration and achieving goals. I first used this framework in one of my research projects, and I now use it to increase my productivity and reflect on my progress, ensuring that the tasks I am doing will help me reach my goal. 

While scrum is predominantly used in software development and similar industries with intense teamwork, it can be applied to other areas. For me, this means my personal life. It looks something like this.

Sprints can be any length of time. If the project is nine months, each sprint could be two weeks or 18 sprints. In my personal life, each sprint is a week.

At the beginning of each sprint (last Sunday), I decide one primary goal for each of my four "personal projects." Since I have four "projects," I have four goals. I then compile a list of mini-tasks for each goal to ensure progress.

Throughout the week, from Monday to the following Sunday, I refrain from adding or removing any tasks (unless I identify something that won't help me achieve my long term goal).

*I use Notion for my sprint board. Each day has three categories: "Not Started," "In Progress," and "Completed." All tasks begin in "Not Started," and by the end of the day, they should be in "Completed.*

On Sunday, at the end of each week, I do a <b>retrospective</b>, another scrum methodology. The goal of a retrospective is to evaluate what went well during the sprint, what problems I encountered, and how those problems were solved. Even if I did not accomplish everything I put on my agenda that week, I aim to feel comfortable with my definition of done. 

*This is an example of what the retrospective looks like. Lots of space for reflection.*

Tasks that were not completed get reassessed and reprioritized for their alignment against everything else in the <b>product backlog</b>, a long-term list of tasks I need to do to reach my long-term goal.


<!-- Here's is a example: As part of my affiliation with Girl Security,* they generously funded my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. I am deeply interested in cybersecurity, user privacy, and social engineering, and this certificate will allow me to gain the foundations needed to consider taking Security+ eventually.

By Google standards, the certificate is intended to take six months, but I plan to finish it by the end of the year (yes, ambitious). There are eight courses with about five modules each. Splitting it up means roughly three modules per week.

For the weeks of October 7th - 11th, my sprint goal for this project is to finish three modules. -->

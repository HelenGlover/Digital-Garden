While exploring how communities organize themselves, I realized that the structure of meetings—how people are invited, engaged, and included—can significantly shape collaboration. Here are some practices I’ve found helpful, both as an organizer and participant. I document them here as part of my ongoing independent research into organizational dynamics and community building.

This blog is a learn in public and partially inspired by [Anson Yu’s Advice Page](https://ansonyu.me/advice).  

## **If You Organize a Meeting**

### **Before**
- **Do we need to?** Before scheduling, ask yourself if a meeting is truly necessary. Could the information be shared via email, chat, or a quick document? Meetings take time. Only schedule them when discussion or real-time decision-making adds value.
- **Be intentional with scheduling.** Always suggest multiple times (at least 3–5 options) and send the times in participants’ time zones. Send the invite at least 1–3 weeks in advance, depending on urgency.
- **Choose the right format.** Big-picture “visioning” sessions work well in person. Virtual meetings are best for coordination, check-ins, and task updates, but they can drift as participants are more distracted or not on camera.
- **Always have an agenda.** It doesn’t have to be formal; bullet points work. Assume most people won’t read it beforehand, so give context when discussing a new item.
- **Rethink default durations.** Even if you schedule 5 minutes, people will talk for 30. If it's under 30, maybe just text or email.
- **Prep your presenters.** Check in with those expected to share updates, especially quieter participants.
- **Set the tone.** If it fits your team culture, use friendlier language like “chat,” “sync,” or “meet-up” instead of “meeting.”
- **The type of meeting matters.** Tools like Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams have different strengths; Google Meet is often a good middle ground.
- **Food.** If in person, consider bringing food—or ask others to contribute. It helps maintain morale.

### **During**
- **Start with care.** Ask how people are doing before diving into the agenda. Small moments of genuine connection help camaraderie.
- **Be detailed, but concise.** Provide enough context to follow without overexplaining.
- **Guide, then step back.** Outline topics upfront, then facilitate discussion and invite input. Give quieter participants space to contribute.  
  - *Example*: “Ann, what do you think about this new tool? I know you have experience with software engineering.”
- **Mind your language.** Use softer alternatives like:  
  - “Can you explain more? I’m not sure I understand.”  
  - “That’s interesting, I see it a bit differently.”
- **Keep it human.** Lighthearted moments make meetings organic, but be ready to steer back on track.
- **Document.** Take notes, record, or transcribe so absent participants can stay informed.
- **End with next steps.** Assign an owner and soft deadline for every action item:  
  - “Jack, can you reach out to Sarah by next week?”  
  - “Can we loop back in a couple of weeks? How about Wednesday, the 15th?”

**A Little Story**: 
I was in a meeting when someone suggested a fantastic idea. Immediately after, they added, *“But I’m new here, so you can disregard what I said.”*  

Your ideas are valuable, and no one can take that away. As an organizer, building community in the meeting makes people feel safe and encouraged to share.

### **After**
- **Thank attendees.** A short message goes a long way:  
  - “Thanks, Mei and Elle, for joining! They’ll be leading work on the new website.”  
  It shows gratitude, reinforces next steps, and recognizes contributions publicly.

## **If You’re Attending a Meeting**
- **Read the agenda.** Being prepared improves your participation and idea generation.
- **Participate.** Fresh perspectives are valuable, even if you’re new.  
  - Exercise humility—don’t dominate the conversation; gauge when to contribute.
- **Limit distractions.** Stay present; multitasking reduces effectiveness.
- **Engage thoughtfully.** Respectful disagreement contributes to collaboration.
- **Thank others.** Appreciation builds goodwill, especially after-hours.

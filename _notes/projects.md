In my free time, I am working on several projects. They are organized into four categories based on my interests:

<p>
My research explores how people build communities of belonging and representation on online platforms and spaces. I am particularly interested in youth digital rights and advocating for a more inclusive digital environment rooted in systemic design.<br>

<b>Main Goal:</b> Have a research paper completed by the end of the year. 
<br>
<b>Mini Goals:</b> Interview with streamers and cohensively talk about my research interests.

In my free time, I work on several projects relating to my interests in tech, sustainability, and design. </p>

<h3>Research:</h3>

My research explores how people build communities of belonging and representation on online platforms. I am particularly interested in youth digital rights and advocate for a more inclusive digital environment rooted in design.

<b>Main Goal:</b> A continuation of my colllege research, have an almost finished research paper by the end of the year. 

<b>Mini Goals:</b> Conduct more interviews with streamers and articulate my research interests more cohesively.

<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

As part of my affiliation with <a href="https://girlsecurity.org/">Girl Security,</a> they generously funded my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. This certification is valuable for deepening my understanding of the field and laying the groundwork for possibly pursuing CompTIA Security+. 

<b>Main Goal:</b> To finish the certificate by the end of the year. According to Google standards, the certificate is designed to take six months, and I started in September

<b>Mini Goals:</b> Finish a set amount of modules per week to achieve my main goal.

<h3>Civic Tech </h3>

I volunteer with <a href="https://cib-mango-tree.github.io/CIB-Mango-Tree-Website/">CIB Mango Tree</a>, a collaborative and open-source software tool to detect coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) in online activity datasets. A project of Civic Tech DC, our mission is to share methods that help uncover how disruptive actors attempt to manipulate legitimate online discourse about health, politics, and society.

<b>Main Goal:</b> Finish the tool as a <a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product/"> minimum viable product </a> by the end of the year.

<b>Mini Goals:</b> Strengthen my web development and data wrangling skills.

<h3>Design</h3>

Expand my interests in product design, engineering, and fabrication.

<b>Main Goal:</b> Collaborate with <a href="https://www.hacdc.org/">HacDC</a> on an open-source project focused on sustainability, specifically by recycling newspapers and magazines for community use.

<b>Mini Goal:</b> <i>(May need to be shifted to a next-year project)</i> Learn more about the potential of sketchnotes as a visual communication tool. Focusing on how to revitalize physical communication in our digital age.
